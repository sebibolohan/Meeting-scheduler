The Meeting Scheduler is a Python-based application developed to streamline the process of organizing and managing meetings within a company. Users can easily create, view, and delete meetings by specifying key details such as start and end dates, time slots, and a list of participants. The interface offers structured input validation to ensure consistency and prevent scheduling conflicts. Built as part of an academic programming course, the project emphasizes clean design, modular code, and practical usage scenarios such as internal team coordination or small business planning.

Additional features include:

Automatic conflict checking between overlapping meetings

Interactive prompts for improved usability

Data persistence using JSON or CSV (optional extension)

Support for recurring meetings (future scope)
